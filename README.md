# Redfin Real Estate Website Scraping
Python Web Scraping and Data Mining

###Why am I choose to work on this website?
- Redfin is a website that provides home-buying information to the public.
- It is fascinating to see new technologies are affecting how people buy homes.
- The data makes up an important part of the business of real estate, so keeping it accurate and up-to-date is crucial to maintaining a positive customer experience.

###What am I interested in finding out from scraping the website?
1. Price between different types of properties in the location of the area of the city (bay, inner city, suburban, urban)
2. Which type of properties are being sold?
3. Price per square feet between type of property
4. Price of HOA (monthly) fee
5. What are the features (gas, electricity), amenities (gym, pool) offered by the property?
6. The average number of days a listing has been on the site in each of those five years as well

###Objectives:
1. Find out the median prices of different types of homes in metro cities
2. What type of property is being sold? 
3. What type of features, or amenities of the sold property are they interested in?

###Plan of potential approach:
1. Using BeautifulSoup package and Selenium
2. I want to scrape the number of homes for sale in a given location (Vancouver, BC & Toronto, ON).

I chose to work on this topic because I am interested in the real estate market and how it's changing and I think that it's important to understand how these changes are going to affect society. Redfin is a website that allows users to search for homes for sale in their area. It is the largest real estate marketplace and it has a wealth of information about homes on its website.
The goal of this project is to use web scraping techniques to gather data from Zillow's website and then generate reports about the data. This will allow us to gain insight into how people are buying homes across different areas in Canada, which I can then use as a basis for further analysis and research.
For my methodology, I am going to use Python as our programming language combining the BeautifulSoup package and Selenium to scrape data from Redfin.com.
Firstly, I acknowledge that different property types will be listed at different prices. Therefore, my first objective is to scrape the cost of property between different property types, located in various urban areas, including the Greater Toronto Area or Metro Vancouver area. Then I could compare prices between different segments and calculate the price data's mean, median, and mode. Secondly, I would like to see what the trends of home buyers are at the moment by scraping the sold units and segmenting them by their residential type. I also believe that there are shared common features and amenities of the sold units. Thus, to find out our third objective, we would extract data regarding the features and amenities of each sold property.
